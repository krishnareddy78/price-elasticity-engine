# Advanced Price Elasticity Engine & Optimizer

This project is a production-ready, end-to-end system for solving one of the most critical business problems: pricing strategy. It moves beyond simple elasticity analysis to perform **profit optimization**, a key differentiator from standard portfolio projects.

The engine simulates realistic sales data with confounding variables like seasonality and promotions, then trains a suite of models‚Äîfrom interpretable Log-Log regression to flexible GAMs and powerful XGBoost models‚Äîto capture the complex price-demand relationship. The core of the project is a REST API built with FastAPI that takes a product's marginal cost and returns the optimal, profit-maximizing price. The entire application is containerized with Docker and includes a full suite of unit tests with CI/CD via GitHub Actions, demonstrating a commitment to building robust and deployable data science products.

## üöÄ Project Workflow

1.  **Realistic Data Simulation**: A simulator generates sales data with multiple real-world factors: price fluctuations, seasonality, holidays, and promotional events.
2.  **Multi-Model Training & Evaluation**: The system trains and evaluates a suite of models to capture the price-demand relationship, each with different trade-offs:
    * **Log-Log Linear Model**: A classic, interpretable econometric approach.
    * **GAM (Generalized Additive Model)**: A flexible model to capture non-linear relationships.
    * **XGBoost**: A powerful gradient boosting model to capture complex interactions.
3.  **Profit Optimization API**: A FastAPI server exposes an endpoint that takes a model choice and a product's marginal cost, then returns the profit-maximizing price. This directly answers the core business question: "What price should I set?"
4.  **Containerization**: The entire application is containerized with Docker, ensuring reproducible and seamless deployment.
5.  **Unit Testing & CI**: The project includes a suite of `pytest` unit tests and a GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration, guaranteeing code reliability.

## üîå API Endpoints

The core of this project is a REST API that provides access to the modeling and optimization logic.

| Endpoint           | Method | Description                                                                                             |
| :----------------- | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/`                | `GET`  | Welcome message for the API.                                                                            |
| `/models`          | `GET`  | Returns a list of available models and their estimated elasticities.                                    |
| `/optimize-profit` | `POST` | **Core endpoint.** Takes a model, marginal cost, and price range, and returns the profit-maximizing price. |

## üìà Economic & Statistical Foundation

While a simple log-log model provides a direct elasticity estimate ($\ln(Q) \approx \beta_1 \ln(P)$), its accuracy can be compromised by omitted-variable bias. This engine controls for such factors by incorporating them into the models:

$$ \ln(Q_d) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ln(P) + \beta_2 \cdot \text{is_promo} + f(\text{day_of_year}) + \epsilon $$

Here, $f(\text{day_of_year})$ represents a smooth function for seasonality, handled effectively by a GAM.

The ultimate business goal is often profit, not revenue. Profit ($\pi$) is defined as:

$$ \pi(P) = (P - C) \cdot Q(P) $$

Where $P$ is price, $C$ is marginal cost, and $Q(P)$ is the quantity predicted by our model at that price. Our API finds the price $P$ that maximizes this function.

## üß† Model Comparison & Trade-offs

This engine uses three different models, each with distinct advantages:

* **Log-Log Linear Model**: **Highly interpretable.** The price coefficient is a direct and constant measure of elasticity. It's a fantastic baseline but assumes a linear relationship in log-space, which might not capture all real-world complexity.
* **Generalized Additive Model (GAM)**: **Flexible and interpretable.** GAMs are excellent for capturing non-linear effects, like the smooth curve of seasonality, without overfitting. They provide a good balance between accuracy and the ability to understand the model's behavior.
* **XGBoost**: **Maximum predictive power.** This model can capture complex, non-linear interactions between price, promotions, and seasonality that other models might miss. The trade-off is lower interpretability; elasticity has to be estimated via partial dependence.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/krishnareddy78/price-elasticity-engine.git](https://github.com/krishnareddy78/price-elasticity-engine.git)
    cd price-elasticity-engine
    ```

2.  **Build and run with Docker (Recommended):**
    This is the simplest way to run the entire application.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    The API will be available with interactive documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

3.  **Run Tests (Locally):**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pytest
    ```
